Scene 1 (0.0–0.8s): kicker « 02 / qu'est-ce qui marche ? » top-left; phone already centered at the same size and position as Frame 3 (it arrives with the push-slide); screen shows the list header « Plats les plus commandés » with four empty rows.
Scene 2 (0.8–4.0s): rows fill in rank order — Poulet braisé 21 · Attiéké poisson 17 · Riz gras 12 · Alloco 8 — each dish name fades in as its bar grows left→right with its count ticking (`stat-bars-and-fills`); the top bar is braise, the others ink at low opacity.
Scene 3 (4.0–6.0s): caption « tu sais quoi préparer demain. » fades up under the phone; the top row gets a brief braise highlight sweep (`css-marker-patterns`); hold.

narrativeRole: Proof 2 — the owner sees what sells, so he plans tomorrow.
keyMessage: You know what works, dish by dish.

## Selected blueprint: device-surface-showcase

# device-surface-showcase — Device / Surface Showcase

**intent**: A product surface — a device mockup or a floating browser/app window — is the hero held in frame while its screens cycle through a real flow, showcased by a camera move that ranges from a static hold to a continuous 3D push.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-device-screen-tour, key-feature-floating-window-scroll, key-feature-3d-device-hand-demo): show a feature being \_experienced inside its real interface\* — the surface houses the action and its screens advance through a flow, rather than enumerating tiles or chasing a cursor across a workflow. (Note: the three founding drafts are Key_Feature and variants differ by MECHANIC, not role; the mined stepwise-flow variant widens the blueprint to Product_Intro.)
- Key_Feature (from demo-page-scroll-spotlight): the floating-window push-scroll variant carried to a spotlight climax — a real webpage rendered as a tilted 3D card coasts in (power2, like a phone held up — no spring), header keywords flare on a karaoke glow as the VO names them, the page rolls to the demoed section, and one element LIFTS off the surface (translateZ + scale) under a radial spotlight that dims the rest.
- Product_Intro (from stepwise-flow-completion): a compact end-to-end product flow — setup/auth → action → success/confirm — plays out cursorless as successive screen states inside the held surface, capped by a confirming button press; bookended by title-card beats. The surface introduces the product by \_completing its core loop\*, not by touring screens.
- Key_Feature (from `showcase-carousel`): the showcase-carousel — two surfaces in sequence (a widget card cycling brand skins, a phone frame with app screens sliding through it) gated by interstitial claim words; the screen cycle is a breadth carousel ("N brands / N apps"), not a flow.

**duration**: 5–11.3s (page-scroll-spotlight 5–9s · floating-window 7.8s · 3d-hand 7.9s · in-device approval 7.9s · stepwise-flow 8.5–9.4s · device-tour 9.6s · showcase-carousel 11.3s)

**shot structure** One product surface — a `[device mockup]` or a `[floating browser/app window]` — is the persistent hero on a `[styled backdrop: gradient / radial / stylized 3D void]`; its `[screens/sections]` cycle through a real `[product flow]` while a showcase camera (static-hold, push-in→zoom-out, or one continuous push) presents it. Each screen state holds ~1.0–1.5s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): The surface ESTABLISHES — it `[slides in from an edge / drifts in from a tilt / dissolves from a full-frame title card]` and settles, with a `[accent shape or backdrop]` resolving behind it; the first `[screen]` is visible. The showcase camera begins (see variants).
- Scene 2 (~1.5–~Xs): The surface is OPERATED on its own face — a `[tap/select/scroll]` triggers the first screen advance: old content `[pushes out / scrolls up]`, new `[screen/section]` `[pulls up / pushes in from the side]`; concurrently a `[label / header word / side headline]` updates. The camera continues its move.
- Scene 3+ (~Xs–end, repeat for `[2–4 screen beats]`): The surface ADVANCES through successive `[screens/sections]`, each a discrete swap or scroll synced to the surface's flow, while the secondary copy `[swaps out-up / in-up]` or stays marked to hold reading position. HOLDS on the final `[screen]` (or, for one variant, blooms out — see variant).

- Variant — static-tour (key-feature-device-screen-tour, 9.6s): a `[device mockup]` slides in from off-screen and settles (ease-out); an `[accent-color shape]` scales up behind it (spring overshoot). Camera STAYS STATIC the entire clip — all motion is element/UI-level: a tap COMPRESSES a button (95%→100%), the UI scrolls/transitions to the next view (old pushes out, new pulls up), and a `[side headline]` SWAPS beside the device (old slides up + fades, new slides up + in) per screen. Holds on the final screen. No camera move, no cursor.
- Variant — floating-window (key-feature-floating-window-scroll, 7.8s): OPENS on a full-frame `[title card]` (a small `[icon]` draws in at center, `[feature name]` below; holds ~2s), which DISSOLVES to a `[macOS-style browser/app window]` floating on a `[vivid gradient]` (traffic-lights + `[URL pill]` + tabs; left nav, central content, right `[sidebar]`). Camera PUSHES IN on a `[target region/sidebar]` (active item highlighted `[accent]`, a cursor drifts down the list), then ZOOMS BACK OUT to re-frame the whole window while the content SCROLLS through `[sections]`; the `[highlighted item]` stays marked. One push-in→zoom-out arc, gated by the title-card opener.
- Variant — 3d-hand (key-feature-3d-device-hand-demo, 7.9s): FULLY 3D — a `[3D device]` drifts in a `[stylized 3D void / bloom + particles]`, opening tilted and self-rotating to face the lens nearly flat as ONE CONTINUOUS forward camera push begins (no cuts). A glossy `[3D hand]` rises from the bottom-foreground and GESTURE-DRIVES the surface: it swipes to scroll a `[picker/sidebar panel]` of `[option cards]` and taps `[option]` (while a `[header word]` letter-flips in place); the selection APPLIES — a `[new layout]` grows from center to fill the device face, nav flips, a `[marquee]` scrolls horizontally; the hand swipes again to scroll the page upward through `[sections]`, then drifts out. The camera never stops pushing; the bright device face keeps growing toward the lens until it BLOOMS into a `[light]` wash — a zoom-through "portal" exit that fills the frame.
- Variant — stepwise-flow (Product_Intro, 8.5–9.4s; in-device Key_Feature sub-mode 7.9s): CURSORLESS end-to-end flow — the surface completes `[setup/auth → action → success]` as a narrative arc. Opens on a `[title card]` that fades in/out on an ambient gradient (or a typed `[command]` running character-by-character on a terminal field). The `[flow surface]` arrives (phone mock slides up oversized and settles / bordered log panel replaces the command) and step 1 completes via rapid sequential pops — `[OTP digits]` fill boxes left-to-right capped by a green check, or `[log steps]` pop top-down with highlighted tokens, ending on a trailing-dots waiting state. State advances laterally (old content slides out left, new in from right, chrome persists) or via a dark-to-light scene swap into a white `[detail/confirm card]` whose elements stagger in. COMMIT: the `[CTA button]` is pressed (press dip / spinner "Processing") and a `[success state]` renders with check bullets — in the in-device sub-mode the commit runs a biometric ritual: dim overlay, `[squircle]` spring-pops, a ring draws around an icon, the icon morphs to a checkmark and holds; a slight camera push-in fires ONLY at the state transition (camera punctuates the commit, then re-locks). EXIT: the surface leaves and closing `[title cards]` pop in and ease smaller — the surface exits before the coda instead of holding. Camera otherwise static. For this variant the persistent hero is the FLOW, not one surface: a terminal panel may hand off wholesale to a confirm card.
- Variant — showcase-carousel (Key_Feature, 11.3s): TWO surfaces in sequence on a slowly drifting `[pastel mesh gradient]`, static camera, gated by centered interstitial `[claim words]` (fade in with gentle scale-up, fade out). Act 1: a white `[widget card]` scales in, flips/morphs into a tilted vertical widget and CYCLES `[N brand skins]` (~0.8s each) — one shared layout, per-skin content and accent swaps — while a large `[brand logo]` crossfades below per flip; the widget scales away. Act 2: a `[phone frame]` enters oversized and tilted, settles upright at center; full `[app screens]` slide left through it (~1s each), holding on the last. The screen cycle is a breadth carousel, not a flow — no taps, no cursor, no camera.

**motion vocabulary** surface establish (edge slide-in + settle / tilt drift-in + self-rotate-to-camera / title-card dissolve); accent shape spring behind surface; element-level screen-cycling (scroll-swap, push-in-from-side, scale-swap); button tap-compress; staggered side-headline reveal + copy swap (out-up / in-up); in-place header-word letter-flip; floating browser-window-on-gradient idle float; full-frame title-card opener (icon draw-in + label); camera push-IN on a region; camera zoom-OUT re-frame; content scroll-through; one continuous 3D camera-follow push (no cuts); 3D device drift + self-rotate; stylized-environment bloom/particles; 3D-hand entrance + swipe-scroll + tap (gesture-driven); picker-panel slide-in; template-apply grow-from-center; horizontal marquee scroll; gesture-driven page scroll; zoom-through bloom/portal exit; static-hold (no camera) as the floor of the camera range. Stepwise-flow additions: title-card bookends (fade-in/out opener; closers pop in then ease smaller); typed terminal command with prompt chevron; sequential top-down log pops with sub-line reveals; animated trailing-dots wait state; sequential digit pops left-to-right + green check confirm; lateral screen slide with persistent chrome; dark-to-light scene swap; staggered card element build-in (fade + slide-up); button press dip + fill flip; spinner processing state; success check-bullet reveal; notification banner spring-in with overshoot; lockscreen fade/blur-away as a card expands to fill the device face; commit-synced micro push-in; dim overlay; squircle spring pop; circular ring draw; icon morph to checkmark; surface exit before a title coda. Showcase-carousel additions: interstitial claim-word gate; brand-skin cycling with per-flip logo crossfade; card flip/morph into a tilted widget; oversized-tilted surface entry settling upright; fast slide-left screen carousel inside a static frame; drifting mesh-gradient backdrop.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → backing rule, or flagged special)

- screen-cycling — UI scrolls/sections scroll inside the surface (device-tour, floating-window scroll, 3d-hand page scroll) → `3d-page-scroll` (webpage/app as a tilted card whose content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; primary mechanic for the surface's screen flow)
- floating-window establish + the surface presented as a tilted/floating UI card → `3d-page-scroll` (the tilt/perspective framing) + `css-3d-transforms` (perspective/`translateZ` depth)
- screen / side-copy state swaps (discrete screen states; side headline content swapping per beat) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- side-headline reveal (staggered fade + slide-up) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- in-place header-word letter-flip (3d-hand) → `hacker-flip-3d`
- screen swap as a coordinated shrink-out / pop-in between two screen states → `scale-swap-transition`
- template-apply "new layout grows from center to fill the face" (3d-hand) → `center-outward-expansion` (clustered-at-center → expand to fill)
- the surface morphing between states / title-card→window dissolve as the eye-anchor transition → `card-morph-anchor`
- button tap-compress (95%→100% press feedback) → `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a heavier press)
- floating-window cursor click on the highlighted list item → `cursor-click-ripple`
- accent-highlight pop on the active sidebar/list item → `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow on the focused item)
- drifting cursor down the sidebar list (floating-window) → `camera-cursor-tracking` (flat-cursor drift; pairs with the push-in)
- floating browser-window idle float / 3D device drift-breathe → `sine-wave-loop`
- 3D device drift + self-rotate-to-camera + perspective depth (3d-hand) → `css-3d-transforms` (CSS-3D) **or** `3d.md` technique (true Three.js/R3F device); see camera modifier
- horizontal `[marquee]` scroll (3d-hand) → `viewport-change` (PAN mode on the marquee strip) — _thin fit; a literal CSS-marquee/translateX loop is closer to a `gsap-effects`/CSS recipe than a named motion rule_
- 3D-hand entrance + swipe + tap as the interaction DRIVER (gesture input that scrolls/selects) → **flagged special — needs a heavier capability beyond the rule library (R3F/Three.js + WebGL), NOT a motion-shape rule.** The 3D hand model + WebGL bloom have a _technique_ backing (`3d.md` — R3F, `useGLTF` HandModel, `--gl=swiftshader` for the shader/bloom), but no motion-shape rule models a 3D hand as the swipe-to-scroll / tap-to-select gesture protocol. `context-sensitive-cursor` / `camera-cursor-tracking` only model a flat typing/pointer cursor, not a 3D gesturing hand.
- zoom-through bloom / portal exit (3d-hand) → **flagged special — needs a heavier capability beyond the rule library (WebGL), NOT a named transition rule.** Capability is `techniques.md` → WebGL shader (via `3d.md` headless WebGL: `--gl=swiftshader --concurrency=1`), but no named transition rule covers a bloom/portal fly-through.
- typed terminal command / non-linear log text (stepwise-flow) → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing + threshold state replacement) with `dynamic-content-sequencing` computing each step's window from content length
- sequential top-down log pops / OTP digit pops left-to-right / staggered confirm-card build-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group form; low overshoot for log lines)
- trailing-dots wait state → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; step the opacity of 3 dots on a shared phase)
- lateral screen slide with persistent chrome → the existing screen-cycling mapping (`3d-page-scroll` translateX form inside the clipped surface); chrome sits outside the sliding layer
- notification banner spring-in / squircle pop (in-device) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- lockscreen fade/blur-away + card expands to fill the device face → `card-morph-anchor` (uniform-scale container morph — never tween width/height) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the blur-away)
- commit-synced micro push-in (camera punctuates the Approve/tap, then re-locks) → `multi-phase-camera` (single short push phase placed at the state transition)
- button press dip + fill flip / Approve press-down spring-back → `press-release-spring` (already mapped; the fill flip is its color-transition variation)
- spinner processing state → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal element with explicit SVG center)
- success check bullets / biometric ring draw → `svg-path-draw` (check strokes; ring rotated −90° to start at 12 o'clock) + `spring-pop-entrance` for the bullet pops
- icon morph to checkmark (biometric ritual) → **flagged special — SVG path morph, see hyperframes-keyframes (morph)**; no motion-shape rule models it — mechanics live in `techniques.md` / the keyframes skill, same tier as the blueprint's existing WebGL flags
- interstitial claim-word gate (fade + gentle scale-up, then out) → `gsap-effects` (plain fade/scale chord; deliberately quieter than `kinetic-beat-slam`)
- brand-skin cycling with per-flip logo crossfade → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state content replacement at thresholds) + `scale-swap-transition` where a flip reads as shrink-out/pop-in; the card→tilted-widget flip/morph → `card-morph-anchor` + `css-3d-transforms`
- drifting mesh-gradient backdrop → `sine-wave-loop` (very-low-amplitude position/hue drift on gradient blobs)

**camera modifier**: The showcase camera spans a RANGE keyed by variant, all on a single content-wrapping virtual camera (`viewport-change`):

- static-tour → NO camera move (`viewport-change` held at scale 1, or omitted); all motion is element-level. This is the floor of the range and what distinguishes the device-tour from the rest.
- floating-window → a two-phase push-in → zoom-out arc → `multi-phase-camera` (e.g. dramatic-reveal 1.1→1.0→0.95 feel): push IN on the `[sidebar/region]` via `coordinate-target-zoom` (off-center target = scale + counter-translate), then `multi-phase-camera` zooms back OUT to re-frame the whole window while content scrolls.
- 3d-hand → ONE continuous forward push (no cuts) → `multi-phase-camera` in steady-push mode (1.0→1.03→1.06… plus its sine micro-drift) layered over `css-3d-transforms`/`3d.md` so the device self-rotates-to-lens during the push; the push runs unbroken into the bloom/portal exit (exit itself is the WebGL-shader flagged special above). Across all three: `viewport-change` is the base virtual-camera primitive; `multi-phase-camera` sequences the push/zoom phases (and supplies the always-on micro-drift that keeps even the "static" tour from feeling dead); `coordinate-target-zoom` aims the push at off-center screen detail.

**Overflow (pan/scroll surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** a panned or scrolled surface deliberately moves content PAST the edges of its framing card. Clip it at the card (`overflow: hidden` on the card/window) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.world` / surface wrapper holding the screenshot + any markers/labels) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` errors for the parts that scroll off (e.g. a marker label panned off the left edge). The card clips them visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional, not a layout bug.

## Selected motion rule: css-marker-patterns

# CSS Patterns for Marker Highlighting

Pure CSS + GSAP implementations of all five MarkerHighlight.js drawing modes — no external library dependency, full timeline control. Snippets show mechanism DOM only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

Shared scaffold for every mode: the wrap is `position: relative; display: inline`; the text copy is `position: relative` and z-indexed **above** the accent (below it for sketchout, where the lines cross the text).

## 1. Highlight Mode

Yellow marker sweep behind text — the most common mode.

```html
<span class="mh-highlight-wrap">
  <span class="mh-highlight-bar" id="hl-1"></span>
  <span class="mh-highlight-text">highlighted text</span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-highlight-bar {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -6px; /* bleed past the text edges */
  background: #fdd835;
  opacity: 0.35;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
  border-radius: 3px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#hl-1", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.6);
// Optional hand-drawn skew: gsap.set("#hl-1", { skewX: -2 });
// Multi-line: tl.to(".mh-highlight-bar", { scaleX: 1, ..., stagger: 0.3 }, 0.6);
```

## 2. Circle Mode

Hand-drawn ellipse around text — `border-radius: 50%` plus a slight rotation for organic feel.

```html
<span class="mh-circle-wrap">
  <span class="mh-circle-text">IMPORTANT</span>
  <span class="mh-circle-ring" id="circle-1"></span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-circle-ring {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 130%; /* tight (short words): 150%; rounded-rect: 120% + border-radius: 30% */
  height: 160%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(-3deg) scale(0);
  border: 3px solid #e53935;
  border-radius: 50%;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#circle-1", { scale: 1, rotation: -3, duration: 0.6, ease: "back.out(1.7)" }, 0.7);
```

## 3. Burst Mode

Radiating lines from text center — each line a positioned span rotated to its angle. Use ~12 lines at 30° steps and **vary `--len` (40–80px)**; equal lengths look mechanical.

```html
<span class="mh-burst-wrap">
  <span class="mh-burst-text">WOW</span>
  <span class="mh-burst-container" id="burst-1">
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 0deg; --len: 70px;"></span>
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 30deg; --len: 55px;"></span>
    <!-- …one line per 30° step through 330deg, --len varied 40-80px -->
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-burst-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  z-index: 1; /* text copy at z-index: 2 */
}
.mh-burst-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  width: 3px;
  height: var(--len);
  background: #1e88e5;
  left: -1.5px;
  top: calc(-1 * var(--len));
  transform: rotate(var(--angle));
  transform-origin: bottom center;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst-1 .mh-burst-line",
  { scaleY: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scaleY: 1, opacity: 1, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out", stagger: 0.03 },
  0.7,
);
```

## 4. Scribble Mode

Wavy SVG underline that draws itself via `stroke-dashoffset`.

```html
<span class="mh-scribble-wrap">
  <span class="mh-scribble-text">underlined text</span>
  <svg class="mh-scribble-svg" viewBox="0 0 500 24" preserveAspectRatio="none">
    <path
      id="scribble-1"
      d="M0,12 Q31,0 62,12 Q93,24 125,12 Q156,0 187,12 Q218,24 250,12 Q281,0 312,12 Q343,24 375,12 Q406,0 437,12 Q468,24 500,12"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#FDD835"
      stroke-width="3"
      stroke-linecap="round"
    />
  </svg>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-scribble-svg {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  bottom: -6px; /* strikethrough variant: top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) */
  width: 100%;
  height: 24px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
const path = document.querySelector("#scribble-1");
const len = path.getTotalLength();
gsap.set(path, { strokeDasharray: len, strokeDashoffset: len });
tl.to("#scribble-1", { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: 0.8, ease: "power1.inOut" }, 0.7);
```

Path tuning: the `Q` control points alternate y between 0 and 24 for a natural wobble. Tighter waves = smaller x-increments (~25px per half-wave); looser = ~50px; subtler amplitude = y range 0–16.

## 5. Sketchout Mode

Cross-hatch over de-emphasized text — two angled lines create a "crossed out" effect.

```html
<span class="mh-sketchout-wrap">
  <span class="mh-sketchout-text">old price</span>
  <span class="mh-sketchout-lines" id="sketchout-1">
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-fwd"></span>
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-bwd"></span>
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-sketchout-lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -4px;
  overflow: hidden;
  z-index: 1; /* text at z-index: 0 — the lines cross OVER it */
}
.mh-sketchout-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: 50%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background: #e53935;
  transform-origin: left center;
}
.mh-sketchout-fwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(-12deg);
}
.mh-sketchout-bwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(12deg);
}
```

```js
// Forward slash first, backward follows
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-fwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.0);
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-bwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.15);
```

## Combining Modes in Captions

Cycle modes across caption groups for visual variety — every 2-3 groups for high energy, 3-4 for medium, 4-5 for low:

```js
const MODES = ["highlight", "circle", "burst", "scribble"];
GROUPS.forEach((group, gi) => {
  const mode = MODES[gi % MODES.length];
  group.emphasisWords.forEach((word) => applyMode(word.el, mode, tl, word.start));
});
```

# Stat Bars & Fills

The graphics that give a stat **visual weight** beside its number: a small bar chart, a progress bar/ring filling to a percentage, or a star row filling to a fractional rating. Pair these with [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) (the number) for a complete stat scene.

**Layout blueprint — pick ONE and hold it across all stats:**

- **Single-focus** — one centered frame, the number is the hero, a ring or bar sits under/around it. Cleanest for a sequential reveal (stat 1 → stat 2 → stat 3 in the same frame).
- **Split-frame** — big number on the left, paired graphic on the right. Better when stats are shown together or each needs a distinct visual.

Don't mix blueprints between stats in one piece — that reads as inconsistent.

## Recipe

### 1 — Growth Bars (CSS `scaleY` stagger)

Bars grow from the baseline with a stagger; the last bar is the accent. Heights are authored in CSS (inline height per bar); GSAP only reveals `scaleY: 0 → 1` — never animate `height`.

```css
.bars {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  gap: 14px;
  height: 280px;
}
.bar {
  width: 48px;
  background: #3a4a64;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transform-origin: bottom center; /* grow UP from the baseline, not from center */
}
.bar:last-child {
  background: #ffc300; /* accent the final/current bar */
}
```

```js
tl.to(".bar", { scaleY: 1, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.08 }, 0.3);
```

### 2 — Progress Fill

**Bar form** — `scaleX` from a left origin:

```css
.track {
  width: 520px;
  height: 16px;
  background: #1b263b;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
/* width:100% is REQUIRED — an absolutely-positioned fill with no width is 0px, and scaleX of 0 is
   still 0 → the bar renders invisible (automated gates may miss a zero-width scaled element). */
.fill {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #ffc300;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
}
```

```js
const PCT = 0.92; // 92%
tl.to(".fill", { scaleX: PCT, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

**Ring form** — measured stroke draw (mechanics in [svg-path-draw.md](svg-path-draw.md)):

```js
const ring = document.querySelector("#ring");
const LEN = ring.getTotalLength(); // measure, don't hard-code the circumference
ring.style.strokeDasharray = LEN;
ring.style.strokeDashoffset = LEN; // empty
// rotate the <circle> -90deg in CSS so the fill starts at 12 o'clock
tl.to(ring, { strokeDashoffset: LEN * (1 - 0.92), duration: 1.1, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

### 3 — Star-Rating Fill (fractional)

A gold star row revealed left-to-right to a fractional value (e.g. 4.6 / 5) via a clip wipe over a gold layer sitting on a gray layer.

```html
<div class="stars">
  <div class="stars-gray">★★★★★</div>
  <div class="stars-gold" id="goldStars">★★★★★</div>
</div>
```

```css
.stars {
  position: relative;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
}
.stars-gray {
  color: #2b3548;
}
.stars-gold {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  color: #ffc300;
  width: 100%;
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}
```

```js
const RATING = 4.6,
  MAX = 5;
tl.to(
  "#goldStars",
  { clipPath: `inset(0 ${100 - (RATING / MAX) * 100}% 0 0)`, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" },
  0.3,
);
```

## Values

| token         | range       | notes                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bar count     | 4–6         | reads as "a trend" without clutter; the last bar is the current/accent value        |
| fill duration | 0.8–1.2s    | matched to the paired count-up so number and graphic land together (share the ease) |
| stagger       | 0.06–0.1s   | larger feels sluggish, 0 loses the build                                            |
| accent hue    | exactly one | bars/fill/stars all use the same accent, the rest is muted                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`scaleY` / `scaleX` / `clipPath`, never `height`/`width` tweens** — author each bar's final height in CSS and scale from 0.
- **`transform-origin`** must be `bottom` (bars grow up) / `left` (fills grow right) — the default center origin scales from the middle and looks wrong.
- **`.fill` needs `width: 100%`** — a zero-width fill scaled by any factor is still invisible, and automated gates may miss it.
- **Measure, don't hard-code** — ring length via `getTotalLength()`; a hard-coded circumference breaks if the radius changes.
- **Match the number's timing** — the fill and the count-up peak together (same start + ease) so the stat resolves as one beat, not two; a paired counter's `onUpdate` must be O(1) (see [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)).
- **One accent hue, consistent blueprint** — see `hyperframes-creative/references/data-in-motion.md`.
